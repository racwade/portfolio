# Alexander Crawford's Portfolio
A collection of various projects from my school experience.

### ai project
A group project for an AI course, this was an exploration of using machine learning algorithms to attempt to categorize information. The report includes three different algorithms, but code is only provided for my own portion (the info-fuzzy network).

### operating system
A group project for an Operating Systems course. Features file i/o, folder manipulation, and similar.

### panorama generator
An individual project for a Computer Vision class. This program attempts to generate a panorama automatically, given an unordered set of images.

### related term crawler
An individual project for a programming course. This is a naive "related term" generator that, given a particular word or phrase of interest and a number of sources containing that word or phrase, attempts to construct a list of the most likely related terms, based on how frequently the related term appears close to the base term.

### room availability skimmer
A group project for a Web Development class. This program, among other things, parses through an HTML file containing courses, and files the information about when classes are taking place into a NoSQL database, allowing for room availibility queries.

### texture analysis
An individual project for a Computer Vision class. This program algorithmically determines areas of focus in a picture, and attempts to highlight them.

### ticket seller
A group project from a Quality Assurance class. Features a "front end" (user's portion) and a "back end" (server's portion) of a ticket seller, allowing for different user roles with different privileges, as well as error handling for multiple operations taking place simultaneously.
