TEST LISTING DOCUMENT

Each test is given its own folder, which contains files in the following syntax:

buy1.in <- input file
buy1.out <- expected output file
buy1.tran <- expected transaction files (where X is a number, in the order which the transactions are expected to be output)

In addition, the _generic folder contains files specific to all test cases.

TESTING METHOD

*.in files will be redirected into the program, and the results will be compared against the corresponding *.out and *.tran files.
Problems will be reorded and sorted into severity so that reprogramming can be done to fix issues.

In addition, after most tests, the user and ticket files for the test cases will be replaced with their default versions.

TEST STORAGE

Test results will be stored in the test_results folder, with a procedurally generated name based on test run and time. A comparison will be made between the test output file and the actual output file through use of a "diff" command (or similar).

ASSUMPTIONS MADE:
Apart from questions made in the chat channel and material specified in the requirements, the following assumptions were made:
* Under normal circumstances, even when an event reaches 0 tickets, the event still remains until removed manually.
